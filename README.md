civitoken-d6
============

CiviToken is a wrapper module to make tokens easier to transfer

Make sure you rename the folder to civitoken (remove the -d6).

Once this module is installed make sure you have defined a custom templates folder  & put the token files in it. 
Samples available here https://github.com/eileenmcnaughton/civitoken


Coleman made some suggestions to improve the module/ approach ....
